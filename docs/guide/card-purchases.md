# Making card payments

#### You can now **buy art** and **top-up** your **ETH** balance directly from with your credit or debit card.

We have partnered with a new payment provider [wert.io](https://wert.io/) which facilitates all card to cryptocurrency
transactions.

## Buy with card

#### You can now make a primary sale purchase directly with your traditional credit/debit card.

1. Login to KO as normal

2. When visiting a listed artwork you will see a new `Buy with card` button

plan.
