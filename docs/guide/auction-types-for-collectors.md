## Buy now
This is where you will be able to purchase tokens for the list price instantly. This option is available anytime you see a 'Buy Now' option on a token page.

## Bids
This is where you will be able to make a bid on an artwork for the artist or collector to consider accepting. Please note your bid will be locked for 12 hours after it is placed to give a chance for the artist to see it. Your funds will also be returned to you if you are outbid by another collector.
