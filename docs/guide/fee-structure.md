# Fee Structure

KnownOrigin has the following fee structure breakdown. 

## Primary sales

* Artist - **85%**

_If multiple collaborators defined, fee split accordingly between participants_ 

* Platform - **15%**

## Secondary sales

* Seller - **87%**
* Artist - **10%**
    * _If multiple collaborators defined, fee split accordingly between participants_ 
* Platform - **3%**

KnownOrigin can only enforce these royalties when the sale is made on KnownOrigin's marketplace. If a trade is made on 
another marketplace or OTC (over the counter), unfortunately royalties currently cannot be enforced. This may change as 
wider support and technical standards emerge.
