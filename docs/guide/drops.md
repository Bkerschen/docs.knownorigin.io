## What is Drops?

Drops is a promotion service we offer to our artists, the limit is 1 drop per an artist at the moment. The drops take place every Thursday with a group of 3 artists showing 1 work each. To arrange a drop please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2whPWbq) on the #support-drops channel, and you will be added to the dedicated #upcoming-drops channel where we will arrange and schedule your drop.

You must mint your work using the scheduled start feature to coincide with the time of the drop at least 3 days before it is scheduled to happen. As part of this service we will help you to promote your drop with emails and tweets about your incoming drop. Ideally we advise for artists doing drops to be available on Discord to answer any questions from potential buyers concerning their drops.
