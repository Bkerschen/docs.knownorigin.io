# :fire: Drops

## What is Drops?

Drops is a promotion service we offer to our artists, the limit is 1 drop per an artist at the moment. The drops take place every Thursday with a group of 4 artists showing 1 work each. To arrange a drop please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2whPWbq) on the #support-drops channel, and you will be added to the dedicated #upcoming-drops channel where we will arrange and schedule your drop.


## Participating in a Drop?
You must mint your work using the scheduled sale feature to coincide with the time of our drop at least 5 days before it is scheduled to happen. As part of this service we will help you to promote your drop with emails and tweets about your incoming drop. Ideally we advise for artists doing drops to be available on Discord to answer any questions from potential buyers concerning their drops.


## How we arrange the Drops?
Artist can apply to take part in the KnownOrigin Drops. Simply check the #Apply-for-drops discord channel and put your name forward.
Our artist liaison will check the Drop schedulre and add the artist to the next available date. We will contact the artist at least a week before the dedicated drop. All the artists that are taking part in the upcoming drop will be added to the #upcoming-drops channel and discord, this is where we share the set-up and details of the drop. 


## Setting up your drop?
Once an artist has been added to the #upcoming-drops channel in Discord they are instructed to upload their artwork for a dedicated time and date. We request the artists use the 'Schedule Sale' feature on the upload form. The artist must enasure that they select the correct time and date on the 'Schedule sale' feature, this will display the artwork but it will not be available to purchse until the exact time and date selected. This allows the KnownOrigin team to add this artworks to the Drop spage and set up the promottional material
