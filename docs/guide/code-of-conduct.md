# Code of Conduct

## What is a code of conduct?

A code of conduct is a set of rules outlining the norms, rules, and responsibilities or proper practices of an individual party or an organisation
who is interacting with the KnownOrigin community and its platform. 

Primarily aimed at not being a dick! [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct)

## The code!

KnownOrigin wants things to simple, we don't want complicated workflows and complicated relationships and expect everyone to be respectful to all. 

At the end of the day the name of the game is respect, be respectful to all and treat others as you would expect to be treated.  

As Google says "Don't be evil", if you see something that you think isn’t right – speak up!

### For all community members

* Treat all members of the community with respect
* If problems arise, talk to each other first and try to come to an understanding
* Be inclusive, non-judgemental and polite to all
* Flag scams, fakes and other problems to the wider community in order to get them resolved as quick as possible 
* Do not threaten or attack any community member or member of the KO team

### For creatives

* Ensure you always accredit your artworks where applicable
* Ensure your artworks are always unique on the KnownOrigin platform
* Ensure you always seek permission to use someone else's work - remixes/collages can be great but often artists prefer to be consulted

* Ensure when making collaborative work, you seek the permission to add someone as a collaborator
