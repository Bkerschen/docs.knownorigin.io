# Changing listing type

You are able to change the listing type of your own listings on both primary and secondary. The option to do this can be accessed from the three dots (...) button. This can be found in the bottom right of any artworks that you have minted or collected within the artworks (primary) and collection (secondary) tab on your profile.
