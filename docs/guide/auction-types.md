# Auction types 

## Buy now
This is where you will be able to purchase tokens for the list price instantly. This option is available anytime you see a 'Buy Now' option on a token page.

## Bids
This is where you will be able to make a bid on an artwork for the artist or collector to consider accepting. Please note your bid will be locked for 12 hours after it is placed to give a chance for the artist to see it. Your funds will also be returned to you if you are outbid by another collector. 


## 24hr reserve auction

For these a reserve price will be set by the creator (this can later be changed from the three dots (...) menu). The reserve price means that only bids that match or exceed it will start the 24-hour countdown timer. Until this bid is beaten it will be locked until the end of the auction. 

If the first bid to meet the reserve is beaten that higher bid will then also be locked till the conclusion of the auction and the same applies for any further bids. If an additional bid is made within the last 15 minutes of the countdown an additional 15 minutes is added to the timer. Please note that once the auction has finished either the seller or the buyer will need to result the auction. Resulting the auction can be done in the 'offers' tab on their profiles.
