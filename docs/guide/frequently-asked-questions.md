# Frequently asked questions

#### Why does it cost so much to mint?
If the Ethereum network has a spike in usage due to a rapid price rise or drop the price of gas will rise alongside this. As a consequence the cost of minting a piece of work will also increase if you attempt to mint in a period of intense usage. If you have been quoted an unusually high price for minting we recommend you hold off and keep checking a gas price checker like this one [GAS Now](https://www.gasnow.org/) till the price has normailsed. If the average price of gas is above 75 GWEI we would recommend waiting till the price drops again. You are also able to send a transaction through at a lower price than the average, though these do take a bit longer than those sent through at higher gas.
