#### Why does it cost so much to mint?
If the Ethereum network has a spike in usage due to a rapid price rise or drop for example the price of gas will rise alongside this. As a consequence the cost of minting a piece of work will also increase if you attempt to mint in a period of intense usage. If you have been quoted an unusually high price for minting we recommend you hold off and keep checking a gas price checker like this one [GAS Now](https://www.gasnow.org/) till the price has normailsed. If the average price of gas is above 75 GWEI we would recommend waiting till the price drops again. You are also able to send transaction through at a lower price than average though these do take a bit longer than those sent through at higher gas.
