# Verifying on Discord

**Note: This is not mandatory; if you don't want to verify you will see all the public channels ;)**

We realise this is not super simple but it works and will help make the Discord a better place and unlock relevant channels.

## The journey to enlightenment...

**By verifying yourself we can give you more _roles_ and unlock various group and channels**

1. Go to the channel `#ðŸ¤–-botty-mcbotface` in the community group
2. Type `!verify`
3. You should get a DM from NFT42 bot

4. Follow the link to verfiy to the page that allows you to "connect your wallet". 

**Ensure you are logged into the correct Discord account you use on KO Discord**

5. Connect your wallet to identify your **public** key. We never ask for your private key...ever.
6. Sign a offchain message (this costs no GAS) and lets the bot link your discord user to your KO account (identified by your public key on Ethereum)
8. When it says _"Authentication successful you may return to discord"_ head back to discord's `#ðŸ¤–-botty-mcbotface` channel. 
9. Type `!ko claim` and you will get roles you are due. You see a little green tick when this work.
