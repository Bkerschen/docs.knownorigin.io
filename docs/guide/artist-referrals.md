# Artist Referrals

## What are referrals?

These are a way of verified artists to refer other creatives in their network and vouch for them as part of the application process

## How does it work?

We use [POAP](https://www.poap.xyz/) tokens which are NFTs that an artist who is planning to apply can claim.

The KO team will send a referral link that look like something like `http://poap.xyz/claim/8kkez0` to an artist on the platform, they can then forward this to an applicant who can claim.

When the KO team processes an artist application we will check if they have a referral and we will take this as a positive endorsement.

*The artist will still need to pass our verification process and the referral is no guarantee of being accepted* 

## Process for a new artist

1. If you know verified artists on KnownOrigin enquire if they would like to refer you
2. Claim the [POAP](https://www.poap.xyz/) NFT with the provided link. *Use the Ethereum wallet you plan to apply with!*
3. Apply to be a KO artist in an application window
4. The referral will be used in the verification of the artist and treated as a positive endorsement


## Process for a KO artist to send a referral

1. Ask the KO team for a referral link on the `#support-artist-application`
2. Send the link to the potential artist (who plans to apply). *Don't click on this yourself*.
3. Educate the applicant about any gaps in their knowledge on the platform, wallets, and blockchain
4. Pat yourself on the back for helping grow the KnownOrigin artist collective
