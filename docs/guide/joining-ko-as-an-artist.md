## How to apply?

Start off by making a profile on KO and filling in this [form](https://knownorigin.io/artist-application). We have a window which opens on the 22nd of each month for 3 days in which you must apply. 

## How long does it take?

We endeavor to deal with all applications within a month of applying.

We appreciate your patience. Once you have been approved and verified, artists will be enabled in weekly batches.

## Can I re-apply?

Yes, we welcome this just review your profile, and your portfolio to make sure it is the best it can be.

## How does the process work?

In the spirit of being transparent, the following flow diagram is the process we use at a high level.

As an artist moves through this process, emails will be sent at each stage.

As this is a new flow and process we do expect some duplicates and issues so bear with us.
