# Join as an Artist

## How to apply?

Start of by making a profile on KO and filling in this [form](https://knownorigin.io/artist-application). 

## How long does it take?

We are a small team. It can take weeks or a few months. 

We appreciate your patience. We add artists in batches generally.

## Can I re-apply?

Yes, pls do!

## How does the process work?

In the game being transparent, the following flow diagram is the process we use at a high level.

As an artist moves through this process, emails will be sent at each stage.

As this is a new flow and process we do expect some duplicates and issues so bear with us.
